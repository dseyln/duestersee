# Welcome

**DÃ¼stersee** is a simple companion site for the Japanese server of [Romancing SaGa Re:univerSe](https://x.com/romasaga_rs). The Global service for the game was terminated as of December 2024, thus leaving the Japanese server as the only available way to play the game. As there may be people interested in continuing to play the game despite not knowing any Japanese, this site was created in order to provide an easily accessible and digestible content pipeline to immediately dive into the game.

Veterans of the Global server who are looking to transition long-term into the Japanese server may also find benefit in this site as the game has had significant changes in `v4.x` compared to the Global server.

This website does not contain raw information or data on styles. If you wish to look up style information directly, please kindly refer to either of these two databases:

* [Nao's RomaSaga Convenience Tool](https://nao-romasaga.github.io/style.html)
* [rsrs.xyz](https://rsrs.xyz/#styles)

`rsrs.xyz` has English navigation, but as the information is pulled directly from the game itself, the style information will also be in Japanese. However, unlike Nao's website, this one can be machine translated if you cannot read Japanese.
